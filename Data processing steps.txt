Steps for processing R-code of riparian recruitment probabilities.

1. Source functions.R.

2. Run hydrology_process_site5.R (or equivalent file for another site) to calculate hydrology condition probabilities.

3. Run hydrology_network_site5.R (or equivalent file for another site) to construct Bayesian network.

4. Run grid_network_states.R to populate evidence from grids and process evidence in the network.
